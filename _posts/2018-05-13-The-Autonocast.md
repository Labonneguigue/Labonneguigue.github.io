The podcast from Kirsten Korosec, Alex Roy, and Ed Niedermeyer is an absolute gold mine of information about the emerging Self-Driving Vehicle technology and the "new mobility" solutions.

It started in September 2016 with Damon Lavrinc, who left since, replaced by Kirsten. Guests are constantly invited on the show to talk about their ideas such as lately Ro Gupta from [Carmera](https://www.carmera.com), Ed Olson from [May Mobility](https://maymobility.com) and Xiaodi Hou and Chuck Price of [TuSimple](http://tusimple.ai).

They provide a very critical analysis of this new industry which I appreciate a lot.

Even though the focus is Self-Driving Cars, they give us some insight on a broader level to understand every aspect of this upcoming revolution:

* Nobody can't talk about Self-Driving Cars without talking about regulation.
